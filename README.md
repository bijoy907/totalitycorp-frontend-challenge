In this project mainly i focus on the UI style/design part, where I use React to build structure & for the style I use simple CSS.
for more responsive use media@.   

* also I use react-router for creating the navbar,
* and for symbols/logos, I use emojis in react, & style over it.

* Approach for creating
I divided the full page into some small divs, where it helps me to design the main UI part.

If I get more time then I'll focus on functional parts.
